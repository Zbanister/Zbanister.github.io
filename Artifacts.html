      <h3> Literature </h3>
        
      My first artifact is literature, I worked on a poem to do with the Scarlet Letter. My poem was about what Hester would talk to Dimmesdale about freely about her opinion, which clearly wasnt allowed in Puritan Society. I worked very hard on this poem and had a lot of fun writing it! I would like to compare my Scarlet Letter Essay with my Scarlet Letter Poem, I chose to compare these two because these two assignments showed two completely different grades and approaches to the assignment. For example, my essay was poorly written due to my lack of word knowledge and grammar usuge. On the other hand, I had prepared for my poem and had studied new words which strengthened my grammar and word usage. This resulted in me getting a higher grade and getting more valued feedback.

    <h3> Math</h3>
        
        My second artifact is my math notebook, this is where I put all my notes to help me during the test and how I review...this greatly improved my grades and my understanding of different concepts.  My math journal is also great for looking back on old concepts and brushing up on it.  This relates to my habits of mind with organization, and commitment. I have also been enjoying math a lot more...

        <h3> Spanish </h3>
        
        I have finished working on a project with a partner. For this project we needed to write a conversation in Spanish which we would then present in class. (El Hospital y Doler).  My partner and I worked on constucting a conversation which tested our thinking, listening, and comprehension skills.

        <h3> Social Studies</h3>
        
        Recently in social studies I have worked on my Colonial Map and have used my strength in organization,  I have also used tougher words and used them in better context. I also used better coordination of when certain dates were due in my project. I also spread out the work load throughout the week so I was not stressed and didn't rush it, I took my time throughout the week.
