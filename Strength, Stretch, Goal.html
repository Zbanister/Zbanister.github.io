  <body> These are some stretches, strengths, and my goals. 
      <h2> Stretches</h2> 
        
     Some stretches I had was to be organized with my work. And to have a clear mindset when going into tests and quizzes. My original stretch was to have a better vocabulary which would help improve my essay writing and better clarification of subjects. One of the requirements for the ISEE was a verbal reasoning section, this made me have to memorize 100+ words which tremendously improved my vocabulary. Another old stretch of mine was to ask more clarifying questions. In other words, I would start asking questions that were confusing in the subject and would clarify the lesson. I have started asking more questions and since then I have seen my grade improve a lot.
        
     <h2>Strengths </h2> 
    My strength originally was to have an expanded vocabulary. This started by studying 50-100 words a week and using them in context. This system happened for around 3 months and since then, my essays have had a deeper meaning and made a lot more sense. I have also enjoyed writing a lot more. For example I have started writing a few poems at home, just for enjoyment. Which surprised me.
     
    <h2>Goals </h2>
    The goal I set in the fall was to have better time management and be more productive. I worked by getting my homework done earlier and remain focus throughout the period. This made me complete ALL my homework in just a few hours and then I would have more time to do things that were more important to me. I would modify my plan by starting minutes after I return from school, I have seen that I retain focus for a longer period of time and are more motivated to finish homework.
